It is an Intermediate-level task. In this case, I have to create a Decision Tree Algorithm on Iris-Dataset.
I have done all the process from scratch. Start from the importing packages, Analyzing Data, Visualizing Data and applied Decision Tree Algorithm on Iris-Dataset
The Decision Tree Algorithm gives me 89.47% on the Iris Dataset.
