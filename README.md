Intermediate Level Task 2

Title: Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm
Problem Statement: Create the Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it graphically
It is an Intermediate-level task. In this case, I have to create a Decision Tree Algorithm on Iris-Dataset.
I have done all the process from scratch. Start from the importing packages, Analyzing Data, Visualizing Data and applied Decision Tree Algorithm on Iris-Dataset
The Decision Tree Algorithm gives me 89.47% on the Iris Dataset. Whenever new data feed to my model, it will act accordingly.
